# Ubuntu Backup System Summary

## What We've Set Up

Your btrfs backup system is now organized in `/home/joey/btrfs-backup/` with the following components:

### Core Scripts:
1. **system_backup.sh** - Full system backup using rsync (works on live system)
2. **config_backup.sh** - Quick configuration and user data backup (fixed & working)

### Recovery & Management:
3. **remote_recovery.sh** - Emergency remote recovery script (tested & working)
4. **system_restore.sh** - Comprehensive restore instructions
5. **backup_status.sh** - Check backup status and disk usage
6. **test_backup_system.sh** - Test and verify backup integrity

## Backup Strategy

### For Regular Use (Live System):
- **Full System Backup**: `sudo ./system_backup.sh`
  - Creates complete system backup to `/mnt/storage/system-backups/`
  - Includes all system files, configurations, and user data
  - Excludes temporary files and mount points
  - Takes ~10-30 minutes depending on data size

- **Config Backup**: `./config_backup.sh` 
  - Quick backup of configurations and user data
  - Takes only a few minutes
  - Good for daily automated backups

### For Complete System Snapshots:
- Use `system_snapshot.sh` when booted from live USB
- Creates true btrfs snapshots for instant rollback

## How to Roll Back Your System

### Method 1: Full System Restore (Complete Rollback)
**Requirements: Boot from Ubuntu Live USB**

1. Boot from Live USB
2. Mount your drives:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv /mnt/system
   sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/storage
   ```
3. Backup current system (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo mv /mnt/system /mnt/system_old_$(date +%Y%m%d)
   ```
4. Restore from backup:
   ```bash
   sudo rsync -aAXH /mnt/storage/system-backups/CHOSEN_BACKUP/ /mnt/system/
   ```
5. Reinstall bootloader:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/system/boot
   sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/system/boot/efi
   sudo chroot /mnt/system
   grub-install /dev/nvme0n1
   update-grub
   exit
   ```
6. Reboot

### Method 2: Selective File Restore (Safe while running)
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/restore
sudo mount --bind /mnt/storage/system-backups/CHOSEN_BACKUP /mnt/restore
sudo cp /mnt/restore/path/to/file /path/to/destination
sudo umount /mnt/restore
```

### Method 3: Configuration-Only Restore
```bash
# Restore specific config files from config backup
sudo cp -r /mnt/storage/config-backups/CHOSEN_BACKUP/etc/nginx /etc/
# Or restore user configs
cp -r /mnt/storage/config-backups/CHOSEN_BACKUP/home/joey/.bashrc ~/
```

## Testing Your Backups

1. **Run backup test**: `./test_backup_system.sh`
2. **Create a test backup**: `sudo ./system_backup_improved.sh`
3. **Verify backup contents**: Check `/mnt/storage/system-backups/`
4. **Practice restore in VM**: Test restore procedures before you need them

## Automation (Optional)

Add to crontab for automated backups:
```bash
# Daily config backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /home/joey/btrfs-backup/config_backup.sh

# Weekly full system backup on Sundays at 3 AM
0 3 * * 0 /home/joey/btrfs-backup/system_backup.sh
```

## Storage Locations

- **Full System Backups**: `/mnt/storage/system-backups/`
- **Config Backups**: `/mnt/storage/config-backups/`
- **Snapshots**: `/mnt/snapshots/system/` (when using btrfs snapshots)

Your 7.3TB storage drive provides plenty of space for multiple full system backups.

## Next Steps

1. Enter your password to complete the test backup
2. Verify the backup completed successfully
3. Practice a selective file restore
4. Set up automated daily config backups
5. Test the complete restore procedure in a VM

Remember: The best backup is one you've tested restoring from!
